## This coming paragraph??

We designed Kube as a small and inconspicuous helper for the professional developers and designers. Why an emphasis on “professional”? Well, because Kube is neither a kit of ready elements nor a set of templates; Kube is mainly a tool, which helps to keep routine tasks to a minimum. Kube doesn’t impose its own styles and doesn’t require following any specific design rules or practices. It makes Kube ideal for creative and challenging tasks of making unique websites with the unique design. For those who know HTML/CSS/JS inside out, Kube may become an irreplaceable tool that saves countless hours of work.

If you are new to HTML/CSS/JS, then you may have a hard time implementing Kube in your projects, and it may just not be a tool for you yet. But certainly feel free to download and explore Kube, and see where this journey will take you!
