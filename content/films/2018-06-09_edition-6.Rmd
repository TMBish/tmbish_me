# Hounds Of Love

<b> Tom: </b> <br>

Following what seems to be a new Australian cinematic trend (chilling, gritty true crime) we follow the abduction and tormenting of a 17 year old Perth girl in the 1980s by a very odd couple. Apparently drawing inspiration from a raft of different true crime stories it supposedly most resembles the serial rape / abduction / murders by David and Catherine Birnie in the 1980s. This film is everybit as disturbing & harrowing as *Snowtown*; and that's saying something. Stepehn Curry ("If Dad is the backbone, mum is the other bones. All of 'em" - Dale Kerrigan) plays a slightly different character in this film; he is as chilling as the psycopathic John Bunting character who also violently murders a dog for good measure. Both other performances were exceptional also. The tension and apprehension this film inspires until the very last moment is really something else. If you like this *Snowtown* / *Silence of the Lambs* style tension you'll love this movie.

Charlize Theron plays a spy who has been sent to Berlin to recover a list of double agents, the release of which could jepordize the end of the cold war. It's generally not a good sign when you have to open wikipedia half way through to understand the story and the characters because a) it's probably too complicated and b) you don't care enough to figure everything out by watching more intently. The only positive takeaway was an **excellent** action scene towards the end of the film with Charlize Theron's character. It came out of nowhere and blew me away; but the rest of the film was extremely forgettable.
