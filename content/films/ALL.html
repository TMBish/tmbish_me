Joaquin Phoenix was excellent as the psycologically damaged action hero and he probably spoke fewer than 200 words in the whole film; for context I'd estimate the total word count of the dialogue in the film at 400 words. Joaquin's weapon of choice was a hammer, and whilst this is an awesome angle in theory it ended up producing dissapointment as most of the action & fight scenes needed to happen shielded from camera view to avoid an expensive special effects budget.

However, the dialogue, wit and modern political satire more than redeems this film. The film orients itself around a new US government program whereby American citizens are prodded to declare an oath of allegiance to their government. Chris (Barinholtz) is an abrasive plugged-in political liberal who is horrified by the current political climate and who ultimately clashes with his conservative brother Pat and his partner Abbie. Where the premise really shines though is the subtlety of how this event permeates through the country. The film highlights the grey areas and receding freedoms during a transition between a free and liberal democracy and an authoritarian police state. Initially the government doesn't mandate the oath directly it only withholds government services to those who don't sign it, when the government ultimately retaliates to widespread protests Pat and Abbie receive a conflicting and exculpating account of events from a conservative *verified* twitter user, and when the enforcers (not police but strongmen government officials) arrive to question Chris it's not about not signing the oath but suggesting others shouldn't.

The space travel component of the film was created, it seems, as a collection of theoretically cool sci-fi scenes that the director felt like creating. Scenes like: severed human arm has mind of its own, man discovers weird thing is eating him alive from the inside, and exciting damaged space ship repair mission, are all good sci-fi scenes. However, they were all only loosely tied to the main plot and justified with the lazy mysterious multiple dimensions angle. The scientific plot exposition was also very lazy and nonsensical; for example, the whole crew is very surprised when the use of new energy generation technology transports them to an alternate dimension they weren't aware of, and when the physicist on the crew is asked what is required to return them to their dimension? It's as simple as firing up the generator again due to \"what we know about quantum entanglement theory\" he says. Finally, one of my biggest film gripes of all are unnecessary plot arcs that ultimately come to nothing. The protagonist's husband Michael would have had 10-15 minutes of on-earth screen time where he rescues a little girl that eventually has no meaning or significance whatsoever.

Matthew McConaughey was beautiful as he always is, Colin Farrell was fab but wasn't in it enough, and an almost unrecognisable Hugh Grant stole the show imo. I thought it was lacking in some areas: missing some of the key aspects of what makes Ritchie's other earlier crime films so good. 1. I didn't feel immersed in a whole different culture/world/slang. 2. Too many of the characters were either a bit bland or too robotic/scripted (think of all the amazing *Snatch* personalities).

The cinematographic style was very quirky (I thought I was watching the wrong stream for the first 3 minutes) but it was paced well and was generally pretty good. I was, much to my suprise though, almost not sad at all at the end of the film. This raised a metaphysical question about what makes things sad. After a discussion I formed the opinion that to be sad a situation must imbue empathy for a living person (or concious entity) and importantly that empathy is proportional to how long that entity has to mourn and live with that pain.

Set in 1890's America, it is a western which I'm generally not into (I think I might be the only person that didn't love West World) but if you're going to watch some cowboys, this is a good way to do it. Kurt Russell is the town sheriff and Patrick Wilson, who plays Lou in Fargo - Season 2, are fantastic. The move was a slow burn but the last 20 minutes or so were the highlight for me, which included the incredibly violent scene towards the end (trust me you'll know it when you see it)."]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Our Rating Components"]},{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"Component":["Acting","Dialogue","Story","Entertainment","Cinematography"],"Score":[8,8,7,7,7]},"columns":[{"accessor":"Component","name":"Component","type":"character","align":"center","headerClassName":"film-detail-components-header"},{"accessor":"Score","name":"Score","type":"numeric","align":"center","headerClassName":"film-detail-components-header"}],"defaultPageSize":5,"paginationType":"numbers","showPageInfo":true,"minRows":1,"className":"film-detail-components","inline":true,"dataKey":"a0d6d64b5f097cd487dc4561e11f5fd8"},"children":[]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Director"]},"S.

In Sicario 2 Benicio and Josh Brolin are involved in a secret kidnapping operation in an attempt to stimulate a Mexican cartel war.
