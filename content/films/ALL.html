say about this movie. We literally had to stop it half way through (and pick it up a few days later) because it was so excruciatingly cringe inducing. The acting and dialogue was so good, I think, that the quite outlandish story felt extremely real and you were really invested in the lives of the characters (especially Dan cause he seemed like such an awesome dude). <strong>Aubrey Plaza<\/strong> plays the enduring-love / fatal attraction variant of the only character she plays in movies, but always does it well. The Instagram social media influencer character Taylor Sloane was really well done and the Instagram scenes were realistic and provided a lot of the comedy. The ending was a bit of a let down; I’m not sure where I wanted it to go in the end but I felt it could’ve taken a different approach and it’d be pushing an 8 or 9 for me.\n",{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Our Rating Components"]},{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"Component":["Acting","Dialogue","Story","Entertainment","Cinematography"],"Score":[9,9,7,7,6]},"columns":[{"accessor":"Component","name":"Component","type":"character","align":"right","headerClassName":"film-detail-components-header"},{"accessor":"Score","name":"Score","type":"numeric","align":"right","headerClassName":"film-detail-components-header"}],"defaultPageSize":5,"paginationType":"numbers","showPageInfo":true,"minRows":1,"className":"film-detail-components","inline":true,"dataKey":"d60a3eb3f5ddf65b37746b008392600c"},"children":[]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Director"]},"Matt Spicer",{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Actors"]},"Aubrey Plaza, Elizabeth Olsen, O'Shea Jackson Jr., Wyatt Russell",{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Box Office"]},"$3,016,057"]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail"},"children":[{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-header"},"children":["The Blackcoat's daughter",{"name":"span","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["  2015"]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Plot"]},"Two girls must battle a mysterious evil force when they get left behind at their boarding school over winter break.",{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Our Review [HANNAH]"]},"A bit of an arty horror, The Blackcoat’s Daughter achieved a lot; aesthetically beautiful, great acting, but sadly, only slightly thrilling. With two separate story lines occurring together that were jarringly disconnected it was difficult to not create links between them. I find this can take away from the enjoyment of a film, your own theories always on your mind ready to be proven wrong or right. What I liked about this movie was not it’s horror aspects (pretty generic narrative – an empty boarding school and a young girl possessed) but it’s surprisingly good cinematography and vaguely interesting twists and turns still left me fairly satisfied at the end.\n",{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Our Rating Components"]},{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"Component":["Acting","Dialogue","Story","Entertainment","Cinematography"],"Score":[8,7,5,5,8]},"columns":[{"accessor":"Component","name":"Component","type":"character","align":"right","headerClassName":"film-detail-components-header"},{"accessor":"Score","name":"Score","type":"numeric","align":"right","headerClassName":"film-detail-components-header"}],"defaultPageSize":5,"paginationType":"numbers","showPageInfo":true,"minRows":1,"className":"film-detail-components","inline":true,"dataKey":"2821ce4358b8117360716a0d5090f061"},"children":[]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Director"]},"Oz Perkins",{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Actors"]},"Emma Roberts, Kiernan Shipka, Lucy Boynton, James Remar",{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Box Office"]},"$19,980"]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail"},"children":[{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-header"},"children":["You Were Never Really Here",{"name":"span","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["  2017"]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Plot"]},"A traumatized veteran, unafraid of violence, tracks down missing girls for a living. When a job spins out of control, Joe's nightmares overtake him as a conspiracy is uncovered leading to what may be his death trip or his awakening.",{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Our Review [TOM]"]},"*You Were Never Really There* follows a winning formula for my favourite action movies: understated, experienced and extremely reputable badass takes down some sort of large crime organisation single-handedly (think John Wick, Jack Reacher or Man on Fire). However, for better and worse, this film was a lot more gritty and realistic than those flicks. Joaquin Phoenix was excellent as the psycologically damaged action hero and he probably spoke fewer than 200 words in the whole film; for context I’d estimate the total word count of the dialogue in the film at 400 words. Joaquin’s weapon of choice was a hammer, and whilst this is an awesome angle in theory it ended up producing dissapointment as most of the action & fight scenes needed to happen shielded from camera view to avoid an expensive special effects budget.

It basically follows almost the exact same story line as the first one, but this time Jamie Lee Curtis is a tough grandma.

Directed by first time director Ike Barinholtz (who you would've seen as a funny but minor comedic character in films like *Bad Neighbours*) *The Oath* watches like a movie directed by an actor in that it lacks the polish from scene to scene of a well directed film. However, the dialogue, wit and modern political satire more than redeems this film. The film orients itself around a new US government program whereby American citizens are prodded to declare an oath of allegiance to their government. Chris (Barinholtz) is an abrasive plugged-in political liberal who is horrified by the current political climate and who ultimately clashes with his conservative brother Pat and his partner Abbie.  Where the premise really shines though is the subtlety of how this event permeates through the country. The film highlights the grey areas and receding freedoms during a transition between a free and liberal democracy and an authoritarian police state. Initially the government doesn't mandate the oath directly it only withholds government services to those who don't sign it, when the government ultimately retaliates to widespread protests Pat and Abbie receive a conflicting and exculpating account of events from a conservative *verified* twitter user, and when the enforcers (not police but strongmen government officials) arrive to question Chris it's not about not signing the oath but suggesting others shouldn't. These are the finer details that are oftentimes far too heavy handed in other political satires (eg *A Handmaid's Tale*) and really make the film for me.\n",{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Our Rating Components"]},{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"Component":["Acting","Dialogue","Story","Entertainment","Cinematography"],"Score":[7,8,8,7,5]},"columns":[{"accessor":"Component","name":"Component","type":"character","align":"right","headerClassName":"film-detail-components-header"},{"accessor":"Score","name":"Score","type":"numeric","align":"right","headerClassName":"film-detail-components-header"}],"defaultPageSize":5,"paginationType":"numbers","showPageInfo":true,"minRows":1,"className":"film-detail-components","inline":true,"dataKey":"f283b2e6a940be61748e1d4d49dbeb3a"},"children":[]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Director"]},"Ike Barinholtz",{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Actors"]},"Ike Barinholtz, Tiffany Haddish, Nora Dunn, Chris Ellis",{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Box Office"]},"N/A"]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail"},"children":[{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-header"},"children":["The Predator",{"name":"span","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["  2018"]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Plot"]},"When a young boy accidentally triggers the universe's most lethal hunters' return to Earth, only a ragtag crew of ex-soldiers and a disgruntled scientist can prevent the end of the human race.",{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Our Review [HANNAH]"]},"I don't really remember the original predator movies, and I was not expecting very much from this one with a 32% rating on RT.

Scenes like: severed human arm has mind of its own, man discovers weird thing is eating him alive from the inside, and exciting damaged space ship repair mission, are all good sci-fi scenes. However, they were all only loosely tied to the main plot and justified with the lazy mysterious multiple dimensions angle. The scientific plot exposition was also very lazy and nonsensical; for example, the whole crew is very surprised when the use of new energy generation technology transports them to an alternate dimension they weren’t aware of, and when the physicist on the crew is asked what is required to return them to their dimension? It’s as simple as firing up the generator again due to “what we know about quantum entanglement theory” he says. Finally, one of my biggest film gripes of all are unnecessary plot arcs that ultimately come to nothing.

The realism, choice of camera shots, and sound in that extended scene goes right in the list of my favourite movie scenes of all time. - Toni Collette should win an Oscar for her performance here, she was actually amazing. - The cinematography was beautiful: switching between miniatures / real life shots were very cool and some of the scene cuts were outstanding. - This is the screen-writing and directorial debut of Ari Aster, safe to say we’ll eagerly await his next film.\n",{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Our Rating Components"]},{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"Component":["Acting","Dialogue","Story","Entertainment","Cinematography"],"Score":[10,9,9,10,10]},"columns":[{"accessor":"Component","name":"Component","type":"character","align":"right","headerClassName":"film-detail-components-header"},{"accessor":"Score","name":"Score","type":"numeric","align":"right","headerClassName":"film-detail-components-header"}],"defaultPageSize":5,"paginationType":"numbers","showPageInfo":true,"minRows":1,"className":"film-detail-components","inline":true,"dataKey":"f55937bb58ef819125d3ec3af7495da1"},"children":[]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Director"]},"Ari Aster",{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Actors"]},"Alex Wolff, Gabriel Byrne, Toni Collette, Milly Shapiro",{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Box Office"]},"N/A"]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail"},"children":[{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-header"},"children":["Revenge",{"name":"span","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["  2017"]}]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Plot"]},"Never take your mistress on an annual guys' getaway, especially one devoted to hunting - a violent lesson for three wealthy married men.",{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"film-detail-name"},"children":["Our Review [TOM]"]},"Revenge is a very satisfying revenge (not surprisingly) thriller.
