<b> Hannah : </b>
<p>I&#39;ve never loved the Mission Impossible franchise. It falls into the same basket as James Bond for me - action that takes itself too seriously. But this one was great. The action was both realistic and totally impossible (ha), a perfect mix for an action movie in my opinion. It was pretty long, but I was entertained the whole time. Tom Cruise was great even though he&#39;s old as, Henry Cavill was a babe and Simon Pegg was at least a little funny. The final scene was the perfect anxiety inducing will he/wont he action and the fact that I felt so on edge all the while knowing it would all end well is a testament to the film. If you love action, you&#39;ll love this.</p>

<b> Tom : </b>
<p>I really wasn&#39;t expecting this. For whatever reason (probably cause I didn&#39;t watch the trailer) I walked into this one thinking it was like <em>The Cure for Wellness</em> - a supernatural psychological thriller. And well, it was definitely supernatural but I wouldn&#39;t call it thrilling. It&#39;s actually a cutesie romantic fantasy film about the romance between a mute labratory cleaner and some kind of aquaman MIXED with some cold war espionage. It was really quite bizarre. Not suprisingly, on Rotten Tomatoes, it gets a 92% tomatometer and 73% audience score. In my opinion, it&#39;s the perfect example of this disconnect and what I&#39;ll call the <strong>Pretence Ratio</strong> which we can say describes movies you (and critics) want to like more than you actually did. Another other big name <strong>Pretence Ratio</strong> film was <em>Moonlight</em> (98% vs 79%).</p>

<b> Hannah : </b>
<p>With a pretty drab concept, 3 suburban neighbours opening an illegal casino, this could have gone either way. Thankfully The House stars 3 very funny people; Amy Poehler, Will Ferrell and Jason Mantzoukas, and an assortment of funny supporting cast (Nick Kroll, Allison Tolman and Rob Huebel). The dialogue was pretty quick and a little silly - great for a laugh. Mantzoukas was the standout, playing the same wacky character he always plays who I can&#39;t get enough of. The humour wasn&#39;t too PG13 which is a big plus for this sort of comedy, and the only thing that was a bit strange was the bizarre/unrealistic relationship between the parents and their daughter. I really enjoyed this but it might have helped that I had very low expectations.</p>
