    review-text: >
      *Good Boys* was marketed as something like a *Superbad* for 8 year olds and that's pretty accurate. That I loved this movie in the face of that comparison and my regard for *Superbad* says a lot. The three boys did amazing jobs and were genuinely very funny. The narrative was well paced and entertaining throughout, and the comedic writing about primary school social dynamics was very charming. Most importantly though was that it was a genuinely very funny film. Definitely worth a watch.
