       Luce is a thriller/drama focused on an adopted Eritrean teen, Luce, and his relationships with those around him. The movie was about stereotypes/racism, and the many ways in which these ideas can play out. I think movies focused on these topics can often be heavy handed (Green Book, Crash etc) but I thought this was much more subtle. Each of the characters were not what you would typically call racist, or even 'bad' people. All were fairly complex and the writing did a good job of showing them as genuine people coming to terms with how their subconscious ideas affect their judgements. Luce is adapted from a play which makes sense as the sense of tension is created purely by the dense dialogue and pretty great acting. I especially loved the main guy - Kelvin Harrison Jr. who was also in It Come at Night. Octavia Spencer was also great but I feel like she plays the same role very often.

       *Relic* is an Australian horror film about the search for a family's eldery matriarch going missing from her home. The film's thematic and symbolically revolves around the grandmother's dementia and her transformation from the woman the family used to know. Itâ€™s the directorial debut of Natalie James and is a really impressive horror film. There has been many very impressive Australian horror films in recent years including *The Babadook*, *The Loved Ones*, and *Killing Ground*. Hopefully, this becomes our cinematic niche!

       *Ready Or Not* is a comedy horror that follows the wedding night of Grace (Australian Samara Weaving) as she's coldly welcomed to the board-game enriched Le Domas family. Grace learns the family is steeped in various traditions and one every wedding night they must play an unusual card game. It's a reasonably funny and very entertaining film, but the best part is definitely the uncertain build up. The sets, characters and costumes are all very good.
