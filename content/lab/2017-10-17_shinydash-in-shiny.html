<p>Shinydashboard is built off the Bootstrap Admin LTE theme. It contains some cool elements (value/info boxes) that look pretty snazzy in a shiny dashboard. To use any of these elements (due to the differences in app creation syntax) within your regular shiny app you can’t just load the shinydashboard package.</p>
<p>You’ll just need to grab a couple of CSS files from the shinydashboard package source code.</p>
<p>Navigate to your <code>[R Home]/library/shinydashboard/</code> and grab:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>shinydashboard.css</code></li>
<li><code>AdminLTE/AdminLTE.css</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Plug these files into the <code>www/</code> subdirectory of your shiny app and load them in your ui file using:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(shinydashboard)

shinyUI(
    fluidPage(
        tags$head(
            includeCSS(file.path(&#39;www&#39;, path = &quot;AdminLTE.css&quot;)),
            includeCSS(file.path(&#39;www&#39;, path = &quot;shinydashboard.css&quot;)
        )
    )
 )</code></pre>
<p>And you can use shiny dashboard elements like normal.</p>
