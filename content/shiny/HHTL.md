## Details

Hannah's History Time Line (HHTL) is a minimalist shiny app I built to help my wife learn and retain history. The app contains a simple `timevis` timeline widget with functionality to add and edit events. Technically the app includes:

* A googlesheets backend using the `googlesheets` package
* UI elements from `shinyWidgets` and `shiny.semantic`
* Some extra interactivity with `shinyjs`
