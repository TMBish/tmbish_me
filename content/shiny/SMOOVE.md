## Details

SMOOVE uses NBA stats API data to build a player evaluation, performance and trend dashboard. Built to hopefully replace my 10-20 daily basketball reference searches and fantasy research on yahoo fantasy basketball; SMOOVE is more compact and visual than its counterparts. V1 focusses on investigations of:

* Intra (within) season trends
* Inter (across) season trends (ie career trajectory)
* Ranking relative to player peers (based on positions, and starting status)

Hopefully will spend effort on building out more views, time permitting.
