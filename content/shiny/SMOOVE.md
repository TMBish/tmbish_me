## Details

SMOOVE uses the NBA stats API to extract player based data and build player evaluation and trend dashboard. Built to hopefully replace my 10-20 daily basketball reference player searches and fantasy research on yahoo fantasy basketball. SMOOVE is more compact and visual than it's counterparts. V1 focusses on investigations of:

* Intra (within) season trends
* Inter (across) season trends (career trajectory)
* Ranking relative to player peers (based on positions, and starting status)

Hopefully will spend more effort on building out more views, time permitting.
