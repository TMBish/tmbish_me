      <description>Hereditary Tom:  PICK OF THE WEEK  Being our favourite genre Hannah and I watch a lot of horror movies so we’re quite desensitized. But this film was straight scary. So scary in fact that (and this is no joke) a woman in our cinema legitimately had a panic attack during the film’s climax; she was wailing and hyperventilating in the cinema, it was chaos.</description>

      <description>mother! Hannah:  PICK OF THE WEEK  The fact that this movie title conspicuously begins with a lowercase letter already hints at the weirdness that follows. It has a great cast – J-law, Jarvier Bardem, Michelle Pfeiffer (man that is a strange surname to spell) and Ed Harris, who all do a killer job.</description>

      <description>Whiplash Hannah:  PICK OF THE WEEK  Whiplash was great and intense. I was frustrated throughout and I hated both of the main characters, but I’m pretty sure that was intentional. It’s a story of a talented young musician and his ruthless and abusive teacher.</description>

      <description>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri Hannah:  PICK OF THE WEEK  Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri has a really long title and a 2 hour run time and I didn’t want it to end. After watching it we found out it was directed by Martin McDonagh and we thought who is that?</description>

      <description>The Ritual Tom:  The Ritual starts off on the PERFECT note. A bunch of guys are ominously planning an off-the-beaten track holiday followed by a completely unexpected, and ultra-realistic, liquor store robbery that leaves one character dead and the other guilt-stricken.</description>

      <description>Flatliners Hannah:  The genre mash of science fiction and horror is one of my favourites, but Flatliners is an example of what happens when both are done badly. The movie’s central theme is about past sins and repentance, so you would think the goal is to see the characters as good humans who have made mistakes right?</description>

      <description>Ingrid Goes West Tom:  I really don’t know what to say about this movie. We literally had to stop it half way through (and pick it up a few days later) because it was so excruciatingly cringe inducing.</description>
