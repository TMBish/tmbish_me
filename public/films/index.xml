      <description>Mission Impossible: FalloutACTION  PICK OF THE WEEK  Hannah : I&amp;#39;ve never loved the Mission Impossible franchise. It falls into the same basket as James Bond for me - action that takes itself too seriously.</description>

      <description>Super Dark TimesTHRILLER  PICK OF THE WEEK  Tom : I really enjoyed this one. It&amp;#39;s one of those films (and there&amp;#39;s a few of them) that follow a group of kids or teenagers through some confronting or harrowing event.</description>

      <description>The EqualizerACTION  PICK OF THE WEEK  Hannah : This has got to be my favourite film genre. Tough-but-moral guy, out for revenge with a skill set that can not be matched. This came out in 2014 and I am not sure how we missed it then but I’m now very excited for the second one.</description>

      <description>Bone TomahawkACTION  PICK OF THE WEEK  Hannah : We watched Bone Tomahawk because it was directed by S. Craig Zahler, the guy who did Brawl in Cell Block 99 (see the 5 - May Review), and we were not disappointed.</description>

      <description>Game NightCOMEDY  PICK OF THE WEEK  Hannah : Game Night was surprisingly good. The trailer made it out to be one those generic comedies filled with exaggerated caricatures, physical humour and outlandish awkward situations (think Sex Tape and Bad Teacher), but it was definitely better than that.</description>

      <description>HereditaryHORROR  PICK OF THE WEEK  Tom : Being our favourite genre Hannah and I watch a lot of horror movies so we’re quite desensitized. But this film was straight scary. So scary in fact that (and this is no joke) a woman in our cinema legitimately had a panic attack during the film’s climax; she was wailing and hyperventilating in the cinema, it was chaos.</description>

      <description>mother!DRAMA  PICK OF THE WEEK  Hannah : The fact that this movie title conspicuously begins with a lowercase letter already hints at the weirdness that follows. It has a great cast – J-law, Jarvier Bardem, Michelle Pfeiffer (man that is a strange surname to spell) and Ed Harris, who all do a killer job.</description>

      <description>WhiplashDRAMA  PICK OF THE WEEK  Hannah : Whiplash was great and intense. I was frustrated throughout and I hated both of the main characters, but I’m pretty sure that was intentional. It’s a story of a talented young musician and his ruthless and abusive teacher.</description>

      <description>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, MissouriDRAMA  PICK OF THE WEEK  Hannah : Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri has a really long title and a 2 hour run time and I didn’t want it to end.</description>

      <description>The RitualHORROR   Tom : The Ritual starts off on the PERFECT note. A bunch of guys are ominously planning an off-the-beaten track holiday followed by a completely unexpected, and ultra-realistic, liquor store robbery that leaves one character dead and the other guilt-stricken.</description>

      <description>FlatlinersSCI-FI   Hannah : The genre mash of science fiction and horror is one of my favourites, but Flatliners is an example of what happens when both are done badly. The movie’s central theme is about past sins and repentance, so you would think the goal is to see the characters as good humans who have made mistakes right?</description>

      <description>Ingrid Goes WestCOMEDY   Tom : I really don’t know what to say about this movie. We literally had to stop it half way through (and pick it up a few days later) because it was so excruciatingly cringe inducing.</description>
