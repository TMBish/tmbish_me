      <description>Hereditary Tom:  PICK OF THE WEEK  Being our favourite genre Hannah and I watch a lot of horror movies so we’re quite desensitized. But this film was straight scary. So scary in fact that (and this is no joke) a woman in our cinema legitimately had a panic attack during the film’s climax; she was wailing and hyperventilating in the cinema, it was chaos.</description>

      <description>mother! Hannah:  PICK OF THE WEEK  The fact that this movie title conspicuously begins with a lowercase letter already hints at the weirdness that follows. It has a great cast – J-law, Jarvier Bardem, Michelle Pfeiffer (man that is a strange surname to spell) and Ed Harris, who all do a killer job.</description>

      <description>Whiplash Hannah:  PICK OF THE WEEK  Whiplash was great and intense. I was frustrated throughout and I hated both of the main characters, but I’m pretty sure that was intentional. It’s a story of a talented young musician and his ruthless and abusive teacher.</description>

      <description>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri Hannah:  PICK OF THE WEEK  Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri has a really long title and a 2 hour run time and I didn’t want it to end. After watching it we found out it was directed by Martin McDonagh and we thought who is that?</description>

      <description>The Ritual Tom:  The Ritual starts off on the PERFECT note. A bunch of guys are ominously planning an off-the-beaten track holiday followed by a completely unexpected, and ultra-realistic, liquor store robbery that leaves one character dead and the other guilt-stricken.</description>

      <description>Flatliners Hannah:  The genre mash of science fiction and horror is one of my favourites, but Flatliners is an example of what happens when both are done badly. The movie’s central theme is about past sins and repentance, so you would think the goal is to see the characters as good humans who have made mistakes right?</description>

      <description>Ingrid Goes West Tom:  I really don’t know what to say about this movie. We literally had to stop it half way through (and pick it up a few days later) because it was so excruciatingly cringe inducing.</description>

      <description>OverviewAdding interactivity to data analytics outputs is a great tool to have in your toolkit.
As an R User you have a few major output formats to choose from. However, it’s not immediately obvious how much interactivity you can embed within each format.</description>

      <title>Using Shinydashboard Elements in Shiny</title>

      <description>Shinydashboard is built off the Bootstrap Admin LTE theme. It contains some cool elements (value/info boxes) that look pretty snazzy in a shiny dashboard. To use any of these elements (due to the differences in app creation syntax) within your regular shiny app you can’t just load the shinydashboard package.
You’ll just need to grab a couple of CSS files from the shinydashboard package source code.
Navigate to your [R Home]/library/shinydashboard/ and grab:</description>

      <description>Nah but actually The Intern was ok.

Much analysis has been completed regarding the performing peak of athletes and sportspeople. Statistically, swimmers peak at around 24, marathon runners between 30-31, gymnasts at a mere 18, NBA players generally peak between 26-29, professional hockey players between 27-28, and chess players at 30-35.</description>

      <description>OverviewHey. Just testing the Rmd funcitonality of this page. Maybe I’m interested in the BMI of human star wars characters. Maybe. Let’s see how this goes:

      <description> Details Hannah&amp;rsquo;s History Time Line (HHTL) is a minimalist shiny app I built to help my wife learn and retain history. The app contains a simple timevis timeline widget with functionality to add and edit events. Technically the app includes:
 A googlesheets backend using the googlesheets package UI elements from shinyWidgets and shiny.semantic Some extra interactivity with shinyjs  </description>

      <description>Details Stratton interfaces three different film data sources (IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Box Office Mojo) to provide a reasonably comprehensive dataset of film data for an actor or director of your choice. Use the analytics functionality in the app (charting, loess regression and kmeans clustering) to uncover an interesting, data-evidenced story about an actor or director - much like the 538 article it was inspired by.</description>
