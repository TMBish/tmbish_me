      <description>Details Hannabishy Films is a simple shiny app using the flexdashboard implementation. It reads in the YAML config for each of Hannah and my film reviews (can be read through the films tab above) and presents them together in a single place for you to easily select the best film to watch tonight!</description>

      <description>Details SMOOVE uses NBA stats API data to build a player evaluation, performance and trend dashboard. Built to hopefully replace my 10-20 daily basketball reference searches and fantasy research on yahoo fantasy basketball; SMOOVE is more compact and visual than its counterparts. V1 focusses on investigations of:
 Intra (within) season trends Inter (across) season trends (ie career trajectory) Ranking relative to player peers (based on positions, and starting status)  Hopefully will spend effort on building out more views, time permitting.</description>

      <description>Details Stratton interfaces three different film data sources (IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Box Office Mojo) to provide a filmography + metadata for an actor or director of your choice. Use the analytics functionality in the app (charting, loess regression and kmeans clustering) to uncover an interesting story about an actor or director - much like the 538 article it was inspired by.</description>
